# Hi there! :wave:

Welcome to the repo where I am learning PyQT5 while building a To-Do list application.

### Goal:
- To create a cute, easy to to use tool for task creation, completion and reminders!

### Features:
- **Add/Complete/Delete tasks**: The basis of any to do lists, you need to be able to create those tasks and tick them off! 📑
- **Reminders**: I want some tasks to have deadlines or reminders that will pop up ⏰
- **Colour change**: Customisation is cute and cool and I want to make it possible 🙂

### What I'm working on:
- **The Skeleton**: Currently working on fleshing out the core features. 💀 (28/02/2025)
