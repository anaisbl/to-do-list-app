# Hi there! :wave:

Welcome to the repo where I am learning PyQT5 while building a To-Do list application.

### Goal:
- To create a cute, easy to to use tool for task creation, completion and reminders!

### Features:
- **Add/Modify/Complete/Delete tasks**: The basis of any to do lists, you need to be able to create those tasks and tick them off! 📑
- **SQLite DB**: For data storage :🏭 
- **Reminders**: Overdue tasks ⏰ change color to red to stress you out a little bit!
- **History**: Panel to view all tasks ever created + some filters for easy viewing 🙂

### What I'm working on:
- ~~**The Skeleton**: Currently working on fleshing out the core features. 💀 (28/02/2025)~~ --> complete as of 03/04/2025
- ~~**The UI**: working on making the UI interactive, cute, minimalist (03/04/2025)~~ --> complete as of 15/04/2025
- ~~**Complete function**: writing it so that I don't forget to do it, it is the core of a to do list app (03/04/2025)~~ --> complete as of 15/04/2025
- **Small bug**: the background image is not showing up on the packaged application, something about QPixmap not being able to load the asset, it's on the backburner for now (15/04/2025)

### My thoughts on PyQt5: (15/04/2025)
It was definitely a tough learning curve. I was familiar with software dev principles, Python + CSS syntax. The limitations I encountered for me were mostly relating to customisations :🖌️. Through my research I was made aware that some people combined PyQt5 with Flask :🧪 for more modern looking UIs, and that the people who used PyQt5 seemed to be making tiny, utility based app for windows or the sort :🤖.

This was definitely interesting and I might revisit this app, version 2.0 in a year!! 🙂
